# Introduction

Accelerated aging is a hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), with adults experiencing early-onset Alzheimerâ€™s disease and premature aging of skin, hair, and immune and endocrine systems. Accelerated epigenetic aging was found in blood and brain tissue of adults with DS [@horvathAcceleratedEpigeneticAging2015], but when this premature aging begins is unknown. We investigated whether accelerated aging in DS is already detectable in blood at birth.  

# Methods

- Dried bloodspots were obtained from 347 newborns with DS and 567 newborns without DS from California or Washington. DNA was isolated, bisulfite-converted, and assayed on Illumina MethylationEPIC DNA methylation (DNAm) arrays [@muskensGenomewideImpactTrisomy2021].  
- We calculated epigenetic age (DNAmAge) using a published epigenetic clock (391 CpGs) [@horvathEpigeneticClockSkin2018] and performed reference-based deconvolution of blood cell proportions using the "Identifying Optimal Libraries" algorithm [@koestlerImprovingCellMixture2016].  
- *GATA1* was sequenced in a subset of 184 newborns with DS to identify somatic mutations associated with transient abnormal myelopoiesis.  
- We compared DNAmAge between DS and non-DS newborns using linear regression adjusting for chronological age from conception (gestational age plus age at blood sampling), sex, batch, blood cell proportions, and genetic ancestry using EPISTRUCTURE [@rahmaniGenomewideMethylationData2017]. Age acceleration was calculated as the deviation from expected DNAmAge based on its linear association with chronological age in non-DS newborns. We repeated analyses excluding 61 newborns (60 DS) exceeding mean+1SD for nucleated red blood cell (nRBC) proportions and 30 *GATA1*-positive DS newborns to address potential confounding. We tested for association between *GATA1* mutation variant allele frequency (VAF) and DNAmAge in DS newborns.    

# Results

- Mean chronological age from conception was 269 days in DS and 276 in non-DS newborns. Chronological age was significantly positively correlated with DNAmAge in both DS and non-DS newborns (**Figure**).  
- Blood cell proportions were significantly associated with DS status and DNAmAge, including strong correlation between nRBCs and DNAmAge (r=0.29, p=$5.8*10^{-19}$).  
- Adjusting for cell proportions, DS was significantly associated with increased DNAmAge (beta=0.2419, p=$6.42*10^{-22}$), with an age acceleration of 237 days (**Table**). This association remained after excluding high nRBC newborns and *GATA1*-positive DS newborns (beta=0.1285, p=$3.18*10^{-11}$, age acceleration=127 days).  
- Among newborns with DS, *GATA1* mutations were associated with increased DNAmAge (p=$6.65*10^{-12}$), with age acceleration of 115 days per 10% increase in VAF.   


```{r, regressiontable}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
dt <- data.table::fread("tb.csv") 
dt <- dt %>% mutate(p=ifelse(is.na(p), "", p), obs = ifelse(is.na(obs), "", obs))


# dt[c(4,8,12),1] = cell_spec(dt[c(4,8,12),1], color = "red", align = "c", font_size = 50)

kbl(dt, align = "l", booktabs = T, linesep = "") %>%
kable_styling(full_width = T, position = "center",font_size = 120) %>%
footnote(general = "Model 1 adjusted for sex, 9 EPISTRUCTURE PCs, and batch; Model 2 additionally adjusted for blood cell proportions; Model 3 is model 2 excluding high nRBC subjects and subjects with *GATA1* mutation. "
) %>% add_header_above(c("Table. Linear regression comparing DNAmAge between DS and non-DS newborns." = 4), bold = T, font_size = 44) %>%
  row_spec(c(8,12), font_size = 60, color = "#990000", bold = T) %>% kable_paper(html_font = "Rasa")
```

# Conclusion  

Our results support that accelerated aging in blood in DS begins prenatally, with implications for the pathophysiology of immunosenescence and other aging-related traits in DS.
